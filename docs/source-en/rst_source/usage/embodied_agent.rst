EmbodiedAgent: external MCP benchmarks
======================================

``EmbodiedAgent`` exposes RPent's existing planner loop to a benchmark without
requiring a robot package under ``robots/``. The benchmark owns episode reset,
robot actions, observation capture, and success scoring. It exposes actions and
observations through an MCP server, supplies a system prompt and optional skill
files, then calls ``run`` once per episode.

.. code-block:: python

   from rpent.embodied_agent import EmbodiedAgent, McpServer
   from rpent.llm import LLMConfig

   agent = EmbodiedAgent(
       mcp_servers=[McpServer(name="robot", url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp")],
       output_dir="runs/episode-001",
       planner="api",
       llm=LLMConfig(provider="openai", model="gpt-5.5"),
   )
   result = agent.run(
       "Place the red block in the bowl.",
       system_prompt=(
           "You control the robot through MCP tools. The move_eef tool accepts "
           "a target pose and returns a camera observation. Check each result "
           "before choosing the next action."
       ),
       skills=["benchmark/SKILL.md"],
   )
   # Read the benchmark's own success flag to score this episode.
   usage = result.stats["llm_usage"]
   print(usage["input_tokens"], usage["output_tokens"])
   print(usage["cache_read_tokens"], usage["cache_write_tokens"])

The same entry point works when motion and camera capture are separate tools:
describe their intended sequence in ``system_prompt`` or a skill. Tool names,
input schemas, and descriptions come directly from MCP discovery. The planner
sees each as ``<server_name>__<tool_name>``. MCP text and image content are
passed back to the model. Return camera frames as MCP image content when the
model must see pixels; a text path or URL remains text. Include the task,
coordinate frame, action limits, and observation rules in the supplied context;
RPent does not assume a fixed ``move_eef`` or ``snapshot`` schema.

For a local stdio server, pass ``command`` and optional ``args``, ``env``, and
``cwd`` instead of ``url``. Exactly one of ``url`` or ``command`` is required
per server. Multiple servers may be supplied, with unique names. A stdio
server is launched and closed for every call to ``run``. Use a distinct
``output_dir`` for each episode.

Supported planners are ``api``, ``claude_code``, and ``codex``. ``LLMConfig``
works with the ``api`` planner and supports ``provider="openai"`` or
``provider="anthropic"``. It reads ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` or ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``
by default; ``api_key`` and ``base_url`` may also be passed explicitly. OpenAI
uses the Responses API by default; set ``openai_format="chat"`` for a Chat
Completions-compatible endpoint. The previous ``model`` and ``base_url``
arguments remain available as described in :doc:`configure_planner`.

For a Responses endpoint that supports explicit prompt caching, set
``prompt_cache_key`` to a stable value and ``prompt_cache_mode="explicit"`` in
``LLMConfig``. RPent marks the initial task and multimodal tool feedback as
cache breakpoints. Set ``image_history_groups=2`` to retain the last two
observation groups; older camera images become text placeholders. These
options are opt-in because compatible endpoints may not support them.
Calculate the provider-reported cache hit rate as
``cache_read_tokens / input_tokens`` over completed requests. The input count
already includes cached tokens.

``result.stats["llm_usage"]`` contains ``input_tokens``, ``output_tokens``,
``cache_read_tokens``, ``cache_write_tokens``, ``reasoning_output_tokens``,
``requests``, ``cost_usd``, and ``total_tokens``. Cached input is included in
``input_tokens``; reasoning output is included in ``output_tokens``. ``None``
for requests or cost means it was not reported. A zero cache count may mean the
provider did not report cache usage.

For standalone model calls, ``LLMClient(LLMConfig(...))`` offers ``generate``
and ``generate_sync``. Each response has ``text`` and ``usage``; the client also
exposes cumulative ``total_usage``.

LLM requests retry HTTP 408, 409, 425, 429, and 5xx responses, plus provider
API or connection errors without an HTTP status. The default is two retries
with capped exponential backoff;
configure it with ``LLMConfig(retry=RetryPolicy(max_retries=...))``. HTTP 400,
401, 403, and other permanent failures are logged and returned immediately.
Each failed provider attempt writes a sanitized record to
``<output_dir>/llm_errors.jsonl`` for the ``api`` planner. The record includes
the status, attempt number, retry decision, and request shape. Every attempt,
including successful ones, is also written to ``llm_requests.jsonl`` in the
same directory. Its request ID links retries; it records message and image
counts, text length, image bytes, cache points, tool schema length, latency,
and provider token usage when available. These sizes help investigate failed
requests; they are not token counts for requests without provider usage.
Neither log stores prompts, images, response bodies, or API keys. For direct
calls, pass ``log_path`` to ``LLMClient`` to save the error records at that
path and request records beside it. Errors still propagate from direct calls;
``EmbodiedAgent.run`` returns them in ``PlannerResult.error``.

Skill files are read and inserted into the prompt on every run; they are not
automatically discovered from the working directory. The local ``finish`` tool records the
agent's own conclusion in ``PlannerResult.finish_result``. That conclusion is
not a benchmark success signal; always use the environment's score or success
predicate for evaluation.

RoboDojo example
----------------

``examples/robodojo`` contains an XPolicyLab bridge that uses ``EmbodiedAgent``
for RoboDojo decisions. Its ``snapshot`` MCP tool supplies camera frames and
state; ``submit_action`` returns short discrete commands. RoboDawn's motion
controller executes those commands, and RoboDojo supplies the native score.
The example pins the RoboDawn controller revision, keeps credentials outside
Git, and includes a launcher for parallel GPU workers. See the example's
``README.md`` for the installation-specific setup and result paths.
